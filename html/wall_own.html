 If you want to build your own system, the below points may be helpful :</p>
<ul>
<li>if possible have one computer per screen. It helps in the software.</li>
<li>try to be homogeneous for machines and screens (same screens and computers). Else you will have to fight with the slowest machine.</li>
<li>try to minimize the size of borders (low bezel). (Anyway our software handles borders. They are consider as true pixels. For example if having one track visualized accross the screens, there is no awkward side step when the track crosses a border).</li>
<li>try to have an odd number of columns and rows for the screens. It permits to have the center of the scene fully in one screen. It helps. If not, each time you create a scene, you will have to pane the camera.</li>
<li>one nice thing is to be able to mount screens and computers on some mechanical system that you can easily move around. It is very handy to do social events. (Our LAL wallino is on wheels).</li>
<li>arrange to not place the whole system in a closed area. It may produce a lot of heat!</li>
<li>since for the moment input are done with the mouse of the master computer, this one must be close to the wall in a way that you can watch the wall.</li>
<li>well for the moment our software does not exploit touchscreens, but the future is probably here... (at least for the master machine). <br />
 - have the whole system on a dedicated network (if possible gigabit). If not, be sure that you are going to have some news from your colleagues...</li>
<li>have nothing else running on the computers. If one of the wall_screen program is slower than the others, you will see it immediatly! (And be sure that when your machines are going to be in place, some "grid guys" will appear to use them to run batch programs in a way or another).</li>
<li>then have a special computer to run the master program. If running on one of the screen computers, it will slow down the local wall_screen program. </li>
</ul>
